# MLOps Template TODOs

- [ ] get rid of template_context in variables.yaml (no need. just use args)
- [ ] decide on config bootstrapping process
    - NOTE: probably time to give up and just go with a static config.py.  Best of all worlds.  No bootstrapping problem.
- [x] train task
- [ ] command-line for train task
- [ ] task use case
- [ ] pipeline use case
